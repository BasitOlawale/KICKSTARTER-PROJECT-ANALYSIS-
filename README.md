# ANALYSIS REPORTS ON KICKSTARTER PROJECTS OVER THE YEARS

## INTRODUCTION

Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform supporting creators, has facilitated funding for diverse projects from 2009 to 2018. This analysis aims to evaluate project performance during this period, encompassing project numbers, their statuses (failed, successful, canceled, or suspended), the most successful categories, pledged amounts across categories, the favored category by sponsors, and the evolving trends in project dynamics over the years.

## ABOUT THE DATA/DATA COLLECTION 
The dataset comprises time-series business data, sourced as secondary data from Maven analytics, encompassing 374,853 rows and 12 columns. 
The analysis aims to address key inquiries:

1.	Success by Project Category: Identifying the category exhibiting the highest success rate among projects.

2.	Project Condition Trends: Evaluating the fluctuation in project conditions across the years (e.g., success, failure, cancellation, suspension).

3.	Project Success-Failure Trends: Mapping the trends in project success and failure rates over the years.

4.	Top Sponsor-Favored Category: Determining the category attracting the most sponsors.

5.	Pledged Amounts Across Project Categories: Analyzing the total pledged amounts distributed across different project categories.

Through this analysis, we aim to glean insights into project performance, success determinants, sponsor preferences, and funding patterns across various categories over the specified timeframe from 2009 to 2018.

## TOOLS

Microsoft Power BI is employed for visualizing the analysis, and data cleaning is conducted using the Power Query Editor

## EXPLORATION DATA ANALYSIS AND INSIGHT 

The analysis of Kickstarter's project data unveils crucial insights into project conditions, success rates across categories, sponsorship trends, pledged amounts, and project trends over the years:

1.	Project Conditions Over Time:
The company encountered the highest number of failed projects (197,611) over the years, overshadowing successful projects (133,815). Moreover, 38,751 projects were canceled.

2.	Highest Successful Project Category:
Music projects stand out with 24,105 successful endeavors, the highest among all categories. However, Film and Video display the highest count of failures (32,891), despite having 23,612 successful projects. The top 5 most successful categories include Music, Film and Video, Games, Publishing, and Technology.

3.	Top Category with Highest Sponsors:
Games projects attract the most sponsors, aligning with their high total pledged amount. Interestingly, though, Games rank 4th in project success, implying a substantial level of interest but not the highest success rate.

4.	Total Pledged Amount Across Projects:
Games projects received the highest total pledged amount, accumulating $741,272,909. Conversely, Journalism projects have the lowest pledged amount due to their lower number of backers.

5.	Project Trends Over Years:
The trend in failed projects showcases a surge from 2010 to 2015, peaking in 2015, followed by a decline from 2016 to 2018, indicating a significant reduction in failed projects.

Successful projects depict a rise from 2010 to 2014 and remain relatively stable from 2014 to 2018, signifying a consistent success rate in recent years.

These insights showcase the dynamic landscape of Kickstarter projects, emphasizing the dominance of failed projects in the past, the success rates across diverse categories, sponsorship patterns, pledged amounts, and the evolving trends in project success and failure over the years.

## VISUALIZATION



## RECOMMENDATIONS

1)	Enhanced Support for Underperforming Categories:
Implement targeted support initiatives for categories like Journalism, which have lower pledged amounts due to fewer backers. This could involve promotional efforts or community engagement to attract more backers and increase pledged amounts.

2)	Optimizing Sponsorship Impact:
Investigate why Games projects, while attracting significant sponsorship, rank fourth in project success. Explore ways to bridge this gap, such as enhancing project management or better aligning sponsor expectations with project outcomes.

3)	Long-Term Success Strategy:
Develop strategies to maintain the stable success rate observed from 2014 to 2018. This could involve sharing best practices among creators, fostering collaboration, or providing resources to enhance project planning and execution.

4)	Continued Monitoring and Improvement:
Establish a system for ongoing monitoring of project trends and conditions, especially concerning the decline in failed projects and the consistent success rate. Use these insights to continuously refine platform policies, support mechanisms, and category-specific guidance to ensure sustained success for creators and backers alike.
